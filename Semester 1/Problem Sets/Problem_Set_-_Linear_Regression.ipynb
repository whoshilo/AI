    "# Linear Regression\n",
    "The Whopper has been Burger King‚Äôs signature sandwich since 1957. One Double Whopper with cheese provides 53 grams of protein! That's all the protein you need in a day. It also supplies 1020 calories and 65 grams of fat üò≤üò≤üò≤. FYI - the Daily Value (based on a 2000-calorie diet) for fat is 65 grams. So after a Double Whopper you‚Äôll want the rest of your calories that day to be fat-free. Of course, the Whopper isn‚Äôt the only item Burger King sells. How are fat and protein related on the entire BK menu? The scatterplot of the Fat (in grams) versus the Protein (in grams) for foods sold at Burger King shows a positive, moderately strong, linear relationship.\n",
    "![Scatterplot of BK](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SSpindt/AI/refs/heads/main/Semester%201/Problem%20Set%20Images/BKScatter.png)\n",
    "If you want 25 grams of protein in your lunch, how much fat should you expect to consume at Burger King? The correlation between Fat and Protein is 0.83, a sign that the linear association seen in the scatterplot is fairly strong. But strength of the relationship is only part of the picture. The correlation says, ‚ÄúThe linear association between these two variables is fairly strong,‚Äù but it doesn‚Äôt tell us what the line actually is.\n",
    "Now we can say more; the equation will let us predict the fat content for any Burger King food, given its amount of protein. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the Burger King foods, we‚Äôd choose a linear model to describe the relationship between Protein and Fat.\n",
    "Of course, no line can go through all the points, but a linear model can summarize the general pattern with only a couple of parameters. Like all models of the real world, the line will be wrong ‚Äî wrong in the sense that it can‚Äôt match reality exactly. But it can help us understand how the variables are associated.\n",
    "Not only can‚Äôt we draw a line through all the points, the best line might not even hit any of the points. Then how can it be the ‚Äúbest‚Äù line? We want to find the line that somehow comes closer to all the points than any other line. Some of the points will be above the line and some below. For example, the line might suggest that a BK Broiler chicken sandwich with 30 grams of protein should have 36 grams of fat when, in fact, it actually has only 25 grams of fat. The BK Broiler chicken residual would be `actual - predicted = 25 - 36 = -11 g of fat`. The negative residual tells us that the actual fat content of the BK Broiler chicken is about 11 grams less than the model predicts for a typical Burger King menu item with 30 grams of protein. Our challenge now is how to find the right line.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we draw a line through a scatterplot, some residuals are positive and some negative. We can‚Äôt assess how well the line fits by adding up all the residuals‚Äîthe positive and negative ones would just cancel each other out. We faced the same issue when we calculated a standard deviation to measure spread. And we deal with it the same way here: by squaring the residuals. Squaring makes them all positive. Now we can add them up. Squaring also emphasizes the large residuals. After all, points near the line are consistent with the model, but we‚Äôre more concerned about points far from the line. When we add all the squared residuals together, that sum indicates how well the line we drew fits the data ‚Äî the smaller the sum, the better the fit. A different line will produce a different sum, maybe bigger, maybe smaller. The **line of best fit** is the line for which the sum of squared residuals is smallest! We call this line the **least squares line**. It can be described as `y = mx + b `or more generically as `y = b0 + b1x` (*b0 is the y intercept and b1 is the slope*).You can use the line of best fit to make predictions -- all you have to do is plug in your value for x and solve for y!"
